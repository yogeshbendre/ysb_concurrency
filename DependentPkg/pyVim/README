# README file

# Python files from this directory are packaged for official ESX build.
# Please don't include any *.py file if you don't want it to end up in 
# official build.
# The files are packaged using 'pyvim-files' scons build node.
# If you add new *.py files, you are not required to change any scons 
# build script files to include newly created files.
